## 🧹 Code Style  

The project uses google dock style rules.  
See chapter 3 in the [styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).  
The project also aims to follow the rest of the style guide.  

The most important styling is summarised below:  
* Use docstring ("""  """) to comment classes and methods not #
* All classes should have a short description and the attributes written in the comments at the top of the class. Example below:
```
class User:
    """Represent a system user.

    Attributes:
        name (str): User's full name.
        age (int): User's age.
    """ 
```
* All methods should contain a short description, args, returns and exceptions. Example below:
````
def calculate_average(values):
    """Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        values (list[float]): List of numeric values.

    Returns:
        float: The average value.
    """
